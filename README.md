# prog2006-assignment-1

## Assignment 1

* Deadline: **March 31, 23:59**
* Submission must be done through [the submission system](https://10.212.175.82)
   - https://10.212.175.82
   - Hash: `cg49jme8eh9dbc0db0sg`

## Important
* For generic professionalism requirements refer to [the Course Wiki page](https://git.gvk.idi.ntnu.no/course/prog2006/prog2006-2023/-/wikis/home#assignments)
* The notes below ARE NOT a requirement specification.
* The specification is in Mariusz's head. You need to ask questions to understand what needs to be done.
* Initial [specification discussion has been recorded in the class as video](https://youtu.be/PTospJzUtF0).
* Make the merge request against THIS repo. Do not add your own project on top of the existing project, instead, extend the project by the structure that already exists and modify the required files.

## Notes

* Simple module for visualising and analysing Go game problems.
   * Represent the game state
   * Represent the stones on the board
   * Represent the groups
* Program can answer simple game state questions like:
   * How many white (black) groups are on the board?
   * How many degrees of freedom a given group has?
* Loading board state from SGF files.
* Updating the board state (game moves).
* Ability to detect illegal game moves.
* Ability to properly capture stones.
* Updating the board state via computer-generated moves, for example:
   * Find (a set) a single white move that eliminates the most black stones (exhaustive search)
   * Find (a set) a single white move that extends the degrees of freedom of a group
* For `<C` simple keyboard entry and terminal printouts are sufficient as UI.
* **Bonus for `>=C`** GUI (or TUI) and mouse interactions included.
* **Bonus for `>C`** Write a functions that returns `True` if two board states are isomorphic. Use translation, rotation, and symmetry operations for isomorphism tests. We assume a stones and groups must maintain the exact freedom degree counts. Or, in other words, given two SGF files with a board state only, the program checks if the two games are the same (isomorphic for translation, rotation and symmetry).
